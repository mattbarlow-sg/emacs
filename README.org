* Theme Customization

The configuration uses =doom-ir-black= theme by default. To change themes:
1. Browse available themes with =M-x consult-theme=
2. To make permanent, add to your =custom.el=:
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
   (load-theme 'doom-monokai-pro t)  ; or any other doom theme
   #+end_src

Available doom themes include:
- =doom-ir-black= (default)
- =doom-one-light=
- =doom-dracula=
- =doom-monokai-pro=
- =doom-nord=
- =doom-solarized-dark=
- =doom-tomorrow-night=
- And many more...

* Emacs Server & Client

The configuration automatically starts an Emacs server on launch, allowing you to use =emacsclient= for quick file editing:

** Quick editing from terminal:
#+begin_src bash
emacsclient -n file.txt     # Open in existing Emacs (no wait)
emacsclient file.txt        # Open and wait for close
emacsclient -c file.txt     # Open in new frame
emacsclient -t file.txt     # Open in terminal
#+end_src

** Set as default editor:
Add to your shell configuration:
#+begin_src bash
export EDITOR="emacsclient -t"
export VISUAL="emacsclient -c -a emacs"
#+end_src

** Useful aliases:
#+begin_src bash
alias e="emacsclient -n"
alias et="emacsclient -t"
alias ec="emacsclient -c"
#+end_src

* Org Mode Configuration

** Capture Templates
The configuration includes two capture templates accessible via =C-c o c=:
- =t= (TODO): Creates a new task with READY state under "Tasks" heading
- =c= (CODE): Captures code snippets with file location links under "Code Review" heading

** TODO States
Custom TODO workflow states with keyboard shortcuts:
| State    | Key | Description                     | Color  |
|----------+-----+---------------------------------+--------|
| READY    | r   | Task is ready to be worked on   | Orange |
| RUNNING  | n   | Task is currently being worked  | Cyan   |
| BLOCKED  | b   | Task is blocked by something    | Red    |
| ERRORED  | e   | Task encountered an error       | Red    |
| RETURNED | d   | Task is completed/returned      | Green  |

** Organization
- All org files are stored in =~/org/=
- Default capture file is =~/org/notes.org=
- Tasks are organized under the "Tasks" heading
- Code snippets are organized under the "Code Review" heading

* Customization

Personal customizations should go in =custom.el= which is automatically loaded but kept separate from the main configuration.
